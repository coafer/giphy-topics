# giphy-topics

This is a simple web app to visualize content dynamically from Giphy.com. The main objective is ti use the API from this page to display images about an specific topic, in this case animals. There are certain buttons already created to display 10 animals and theirs gif animated. But the app is open to add more buttons if the user wants.

Enjoy.
